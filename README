	      EGG Versio 4.0 --- Code name "Tamagotchy"

		NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@chroot.org>

We've started this project with the code of EGG V3.0 in the beginning.
However, we chose to rewrite whole of them, while referring the design
and interface of EGG V3.0.

In original version of EGG (to V3.0), it seems for me that there's no
copyright notice.  But it has been widely distributed on the Internet
under the licence of GPL:
